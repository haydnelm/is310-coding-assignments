So for my assignment that required us to scrape data from a wiki, I decided to pick a wiki that is dedicated to a game that I play online. The game is called OSRS. 

Basically, this code extracts all of the boss names from the https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Boss webpage, and then using those names, it visits each and every webpage on the platform that is attributed to a boss in order to gather some unique information about the boss. The format used is https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/{boss}#Uniques, and since each boss page follows this strict guideline, it allows this information to be accessed easily.

Here is the terms of use for the page: https://weirdgloop.org/terms/
You can find it here on the homepage: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/

The terms mention no restricted access for scraping data, therefore I picked this platform for my assignment.
