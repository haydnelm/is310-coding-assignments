Journal Entry #72

Today in art class, Caroline drew a picture of her pet cat. It was an orange cat. When I looked at the picture, it made me think of a TV show that I haven't seen in a very long time. Anyway, after art class we went to lunch. I was starving, but luckily they were serving lasagna today! Delicious!
