Hello! Welcome to my "maze". For my assignment I themed my maze around a journal/diary. Each section is meant to represent a page in a diary. Just go in there and explore, there are little notes at the bottom of pages that are supposed to represent you (the MC) thinking to yourself. They are my little way of implimenting hints. 

Throughout this maze you'll use some simple commands such as

ls
cd
cat

There's one additional command that you can use in order to view images within the terminal. This part is completely optional, you can consider yourself done when you find a file called "art.png". However, if you wish to open the image, you'll need to install a command called imview. You can do so by pasting the following command in your terminal:

     sudo apt-get install imview -y

You should be prompted to enter your password, but once the command is installed you can use it like this:

     imview art.png

It will open up a window that will display the selected image. You can use this command for any other reason that you might need it.
